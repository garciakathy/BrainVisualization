# BrainVisualization
Using python to visualize brain activation

Visualizing 264 ROI Brain Activation.ipynb is the working notebook for this project. It reads in brain activation data from an excel file. A csv file can also be used if the read_excel() function is modified to read_csv()

In this notebook, I show how to:
* Read in brain activation data.
* Gather the coordinates for 264 ROI using Powers dataset.
* Plot a correlation matrix.
* Plot a connectome on top of a glass brain image
* Fine tune this plot to select a subset of data.
* Plot the connectome in an interactive 3D brain representation.

The prerequisites for this notebook include:
* pandas
* skLearn
